# NietzscheText ðŸ§ 
NietzscheText is a bot built upon an RNN (recurrent neural network) designed to generate text by learning from a sequentially-structured dataset of Nietzsche and other contemporary writers' material.

Its other functionalities include retrieving information from Princeton's WordNet lexical database and image retrieval (to provide clearer context) through a web parser.
