# NietzscheAI ðŸ§ 
NietzscheAI is a bot built upon an RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) designed to generate text by learning from a sequentially-structured text dataset of Nietzsches writings.

Its other functionalities include retrieving information from Princeton's WordNet machine-readable lexical database and image retrieval (to provide clearer context) through a web parser.
